# Jesse's dotfiles.

This is how I do computers.  If you want to do computers like me this is the repository for you.

It's important to note that I use Fish Shell.  If this scares you that's okay.  Just comment out the lines related to Fish Shell in `setup_computer.rb`.

# Contents

* Fish Shell configuration
* Bash configuration
* vim configuration
* tmux configuration
* git configuration
* osx configuration (No longer used, but leaving here in case others can glean some knowledge from it.)
* Computer setup scrip

# Install

(Note: If you don't clone this to `~/Dropbox/dotfiles` you'll have to change the path in the `setup_computer.rb` script.  It's a fairly trivial change so fear not.)

1. `git clone https://github.com/jsatk/dotfiles.git ~/Dropbox/dotfiles`
2. `cd ~/Dropbox/dotfiles`
3. `ruby setup_computer.rb` Totoro will guide you through the setup process.
