# tmuxinator starts *not* using your login shell, but rather /bin/sh or /bin/bash.
# For reasons I do not understand we must tell tmuxinator to start tmux with
# $TERM set to `screen-256color`.  Then in ~/.tmux.conf we tell tmux to use the
# default-terminal of `tmux-256color`.  Terminal emulators + terminal
# multiplexers + terminfo = weird font stuff ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø.
# See: https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator/issues/300
