# Fish shell completions for Homebrew

# A note about aliases:
#
# * When defining completions for the (sub)commands themselves, only the full names are used, as they
#   are more descriptive and worth completing. Aliases are usually shorter than the full names, and
#   exist exactly to save time for users who already know what they want and are going to type the
#   command anyway (i.e. without completion).
# * Nevertheless, it's important to support aliases in the completions for their arguments/options.
