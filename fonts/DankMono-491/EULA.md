# Font License Agreement

This is an End User License Agreement (“EULA” / “license”) between you (“licensee”) and Phil Plückthun (“licensor”).
By purchasing and/or installing Dank Mono (“the font”), you are agreeing to the terms of this license.
Before you purchase the font, you will be explicitly asked to give your express
agreement to the provisions of this EULA. Please read this EULA carefully and retain a copy of it.

The licensee may install and use the font on any number of devices, websites, or use the font on any
other media, as long as they are solely responsible for said media. The licensee may temporarily copy
the font for the sake of producing print media, as long as no copy is retained by any third party.

The licensee is permitted to use the font exclusively for personal use. If the licensee has purchased
a “commerical licence” this license explicitly grants the permission to use the font for business and
commercial use as well.

A commercial license is restricted to be used by a legal entity with the above restrictions regarding
media. In this case “licensee” refers to the legal entity for which the purchase was made. The person
who actioned the purchase becomes the proxy of said legal entity i.e. licensee.

The licensee may embed this font into documents, following the restrictions in the two prior paragraphs.
Publishing, sharing, distributing, or licensing media or such documents for commerical and/or business
purposes requires the purchase of a commerical license as outlined in the last paragraph.

to the licensee, or from the licensee to the licensor.

- The licensee agrees not to modify, edit, alter, reverse engineer, re-license, re-distribute, create derivatives of, or sell the font

The licensor issues a payment receipt electronically and the font is an electronic download provided under UK law.

- Once the licensee downloads the font, they will lose their 14 days right to cancel

The license granted herein is effective until terminated.
