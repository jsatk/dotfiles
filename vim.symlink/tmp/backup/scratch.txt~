I'd get rid of the heavy use of ellipsis on this line: "So…no silver spoons…a rough city…and my parents split up when I was in the 5th grade."

I'd illustrate what you needed to "make it out" from before positing that the reader is asking themselves "wow, how did you make it out?"

I'd kill the ellisis in "some extent...myself".

"Look at that vest and tell me THAT I wasn't a good kid."

Kill comma in "Flint, and that".

In general you are a comma heavy writer. I think you can kill a few of these. But you also know my bias is to be very comma-light. So you do you. :)
