# Keyserver {{{

# This is the server that --receive-keys, --send-keys, and --search-keys will
# communicate with to receive keys from, send keys to, and search for keys on.
# As of 2018-11-10 the default keyserver of hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net
# – which is set in ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf – was not working, so I switched to
# this keyserver that is working.
keyserver hkps://pgpkeys.co.uk

# When using --refresh-keys, if the key in question has a preferred keyserver
# URL, then disable use of that preferred keyserver to refresh the key from
keyserver-options no-honor-keyserver-url

# When searching for a key with --search-keys, include keys that are marked on
# the keyserver as revoked
keyserver-options include-revoked
