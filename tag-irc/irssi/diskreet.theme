# :::::::::::::[ irssi theme diskreet v0.2 by bracket ]::::::::::::::

# this is my attempt to make a theme fitting to a light background
# and i also tend to make it very settle by not using much colors
# it's based on my cyanic theme.

# you can send any comments, complaints and/or request to
# bracket@welho.com or /msg me on ircnet.

# changes:
#        - now you can see nicks up to 15 characters in length

# :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

# Irssi's colors that you can use in text formats, hilights, etc. :
#
#                           text            text            background
#   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#   %k      %K      %0      black           dark grey       black
#   %r      %R      %1      red             bold red        red
#   %g      %G      %2      green           bold green      green
#   %y      %Y      %3      yellow          bold yellow     yellow
#   %b      %B      %4      blue            bold blue       blue
#   %m      %M      %5      magenta         bold magenta    magenta
#   %p      %P              magenta (think: purple)
#   %c      %C      %6      cyan            bold cyan       cyan
#   %w      %W      %7      white           bold white      white
#   %n      %N              Changes the color to "default color", removing
#                           all other coloring and formatting. %N is always
#                          the terminal's default color. %n is usually too,
#                          except in themes it changes to "previous color",
#                          ie. hello = "%Rhello%n" and "%G{hello} world"
#                          would print hello in red, and %n would turn back
#                          into %G making world green.
#   %F                      Blinking on/off (think: flash)
#   %U                      Underline on/off
#   %8                      Reverse on/off
#   %9      %_              Bold on/off
#   %:                      Insert newline
#   %|                      Marks the indentation position
#   %#                      Monospace font on/off (useful with lists and GUI)
#   %%                      A single %
#
# In .theme files %n works a bit differently. See default.theme
# for more information.
