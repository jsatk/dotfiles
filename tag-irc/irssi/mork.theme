#  'Mörk' version 1.0
#  A mIRC-influenced theme for Irssi by Eric 'Sho' Nishio

#  eric.nishio@saunalahti.fi
#  #wnc @ QuakeNet

#  Mörk is a slightly modified version of the classic
#  mIRC scheme, meaning that most channel messages and what-
#  not should pertain to the ones found in mIRC. What I have
#  changed, though, are the colours which are now more
#  compatible with darker backgrounds.

#  You should also input these commands after loading up Mörk:
#    /SET hide_netsplit_quits OFF
#    /SET paste_join_multiline OFF
#    /SET indent 2
#    /SET show_nickmode OFF

# Default foreground colour
default_color = "-1";

# Display timestamp at the end of a line
info_eol = "false";

# Coloured characters
replaces = { "[]=" = "$*"; };

abstracts = {
